* Easter, Michael. Why Creativity Is Tanking. _Research going back to the 1950s explains why we’re now facing a “creativity crisis.”_ [Link](https://eastermichael.medium.com/why-creativity-is-tanking-c20029d8fa2a "Link")
  * My thoughts: I do not see the achievement such as cresting a business or writing a book as a variable proving success but this article makes a good point when it claims that there is a disinterest in student's creativity: 
  > _"Ellis Paul Torrance was an American psychologist. In the 1950s he noticed something off target about American classrooms. Teachers tended to prefer the subdued, book-smart kids. They didn’t much care for the kids who had tons of energy and big ideas. Kids who’d think up odd interpretations of readings, inventive excuses for why they didn’t do their homework, and morph into mad scientists every lab day. The system deemed these kids “bad.” But Torrance felt they were misunderstood. Because if a problem comes up in the real world, all the book-smart kids look for an answer in … a book. But what if the answer isn’t in a book? Then a person needs to get creative."_
