Is education this eternal, positive, necessary, universal good as we often associate it with? Education is also used as direct synomym for studying and learning. However, education has not always existed and is not an unique and neutral mode of studying.

_Can education help towards the abolition and the dismantling of systems of oppression and mechanisms of domination?_

In his book Beyond Education: Radical Studying for Another World (2019), Eli Meyerhoff explains the historical development of education. Two historical facts are worth noting:
- the university arose in 1088 as a mutual aid society of students,
- "education" arose 400 years later along with the rise of capitalism, the state, and colonialism

Meyerhoff writes:

"Education is one possible mode of study among many alternatives.

Education’s elements emerged as reactions to people's struggles that were bound up with alternative modes of study.

Education’s vertical trajectory of individualized development emerged with the institution of ascending levels in schools associated with the Sisters and Brothers of the Common Life in 13th century Lower Germany.

Splitting schools into ascending levels—and narrating an ideology of ‘spiritual ascent’ for an individualized ‘self’—gave schoolmasters means for managing their crisis of disorder with an increasing number of students in their schools, in the context of the Black plague.

Along with the colonial dispossession of land, plundering of colonized peoples’ labor, and patriarchal repression of rebellious women, the institution of school levels spread throughout Europe as part of “primitive accumulation,” or the creation of capitalism’s preconditions.

The English term, ‘education,’ emerged in 1530s England when people’s rebellions pushed King Henry VIII’s regime into a crisis of legitimacy. The King’s advisors were accused of being seen as illegitimate because they were not of noble birth. The advisors found a solution by appealing to ‘education’—saying that they had been ‘educated’ in contrast with their critics—coupled with a constellation of binary figures, such as ‘idle’ people with ‘bad education’ as opposed to ‘hard-working’ people with ‘good education.’

Locke calls on the teacher to manage the student’s self-formation with modernist/colonial narratives and a household-based emotional economy--including shame, pride, fear, and anxiety--that creates a system of credits and debts.

Locke’s pedagogical mode of accounting gives teachers educational tools for suppressing subversive collaborations across class, gender, age, and race. This mode of accounting later becomes institutionalized in schools in the early 19th century with graded exams.

Rather than assuming the necessity of the education-based mode of study, genealogies of its elements can show its historical contingency, revealing how it emerged in association with the capitalist, colonial mode of world-making. This can open our imaginations to alternatives.

My book, Beyond Education, traces how the different elements of the education-based mode of study—a vertical imaginary, a pedagogical mode of accounting, figures of educational waste (e.g., the dropout) and value (e.g., the graduate)—emerged historically along with capitalism."

According to Meyerhoff it is important to distinguish education from study. He defines the education based mode of study as vertical, imaginary (rise through grade level, overcoming obstacles), students separated from means of studying, prepared for governance, credit and debt, binary value and waste (dropout vs graduate).

The education based mode of study also separates students from the means of studying happens in school, students do not have control on school classrooms setup (hierarchical relations students vs. teacher, they are separated, do not have control how their means of studying are managed and composed).

I interviewed Eli Meyerhoff about his work and his book (the interwiew has not been edited yet):

## Sociological Definition of Education

According to Emile Durkheim, “Education is, then, only the means by which society prepares within the children, the essential conditions of its very existence" from _Education and Sociology._


## Education and Societal Expectaion

* Education is perceived as the institution that will solve all social problems.
* Education reforms are at the center of attention, shifting the focus away from political choices that actually maintain inequalities.

## Education and Inequalities


According to Roth (2015), the education system create precarious graduates:
* Incapacity of the system to integrate on the job market.
* 40% of 18-24 years old are students according to the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics.

Groeber:
> “Compared to other countries, the United States has long one of the highest rates of educational access and enrollment in the world—and yet, it also has one of the highest rates of inequality. That presents a paradox if we think education is the best tool to reduce inequality.” [_Source_](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/04/cristina-groeger-interview-education-trap-solution-inequality-social-mobility)

## Alternative mode of study

* Experimental Community Education of the Twin Cities (EXCO) using  money from the University of Minnesota, offered free classes without grades. It aimed to break down hierarchies between students and teachers who were instead called participants and facilitators. Unfortunately, EXCO does not exist anymore.
  * Description retrieved from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170307213528/https://excotwincities.org/about/)
  >Experimental Community Education of the Twin Cities (EXCO) is a collective dedicated to supporting community initiated  educational opportunities as a means for social change. Classes organized through EXCO are spaces of learning where people share their talents in an inclusive, open, non-hierarchical, and non-coercive setting. EXCO brings
together community members, organizations, and movements to engage in a shared education mission.<br>Therefore, **EXCO** has many parts:<br>**We Are a School**<br>We work to bring together community members who have expertise to share with participants seeking out information and education not otherwise found in traditional institutions. We have courses where there are no grades, no requirements, and where learning is shared by all. We believe that EXCO classes are opportunities where educational is accessible to everyone.
Our core principle is that everyone can teach or take classes and all classes are free.<br>**We Are a Community**<br>From our organizing collective, to our participants, to our facilitators, and to our community partners, we bring together dedicated community members working together on shared progressive goals.<br>**We Are a Movement**<br>EXCO aims to transform education. We seek to change the nature of education from within our own universities as well as transform the purpose of education. We aim to partner with and help other movements in their educational goals.
