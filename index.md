  ## We must deromanticize education
---

This project is essentially based on the work of Eli Meyerhoff and its last book Beyond Education Radical Studying for Another World.

The question we should ask ourselves regarding education are:
* What is the definition of education?
* Can education reduce inequalities?
* Why educate sola fide the norm and neutral mode of study?
* Can education help towards the abolition and the dismantling of systems of oppression and mechanisms of domination?

According to Meyerhoff is it important to distinguish education from study.

> "Education has been presented as if it is the best and only option for studying. Against the grain, my book takes aim at the romance of education. I contend that education is one possible mode of study among many alternatives"
