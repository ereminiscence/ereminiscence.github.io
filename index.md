  ## Let's deromanticize education
  Final Project for Anthropology and Education
---

This project is essentially based on Eli Meyerhoff's work and its last book Beyond Education: Radical Studying for Another World (2019).

The question we should ask ourselves regarding education are:
* What is the definition of education?
* Why education is seen as the unique and neutrol mode of study?
* Is there any alternative to education?
* Can education reduce inequalities?
* Can education help towards the abolition and the dismantling of systems of oppression and mechanisms of domination?

According to Meyerhoff is it important to distinguish education from study. He defines the education based mode of study as vertical, imaginary (rise through grade level, overcoming obstacles), students separated from means of studying, prepared for governance, credit and debt, binary value and waste (dropout vs graduate).

The education based mode of study also separates students from the means of studying happens in school, students do not have control on school classrooms setup (hierarchical relations students vs. teacher, they are separated, do not have control how their means of studying are managed and composed).

## Sociological Definition of Education

According to Emile Durkheim, “Education is, then, only the means by which society prepares within the children, the essential conditions of its very existence" from _Education and Sociology._

## Education and crisis

* Education is perceived as the institution that will solve all social problems.
* Education reforms are at the center of attention, shifting the focus away from political choices that actually maintain inequalities.

## Education and Inequalities

* Education does not reduce inequalities
* Education does not increase the minimum wage
* Education does not make healthcare free and universal
* Education does not create jobs

According to Roth (2015), the education system create precarious graduates:
* Incapacity of the system to integrate on the job market.
* 40% of 18-24 years old are students according to the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics.

Groeber:
> “Compared to other countries, the United States has long one of the highest rates of educational access and enrollment in the world—and yet, it also has one of the highest rates of inequality. That presents a paradox if we think education is the best tool to reduce inequality.”

## Alternative mode of study

* Mentorship/Apprenticeship (Jean Lave  ethnography of tailors)
* EXCO (Experimental Colleges of Twin Studies) Free, took monay from the university of Minnesota, classes without grades, break down hierarchies between students and teachers (participants and facilitators)
* Indigenous modes of studying
* Black radical modes of studying
* Anarchist modes of studying
