  ## Let's put an end to the romance of education
  Final Project for Anthropology and Education
---

This project is essentially based on Eli Meyerhoff's work and its last book Beyond Education: Radical Studying for Another World.

The question we should ask ourselves regarding education are:
* What is the definition of education?
* Can education reduce inequalities?
* Why educate sola fide the norm and neutral mode of study?
* Can education help towards the abolition and the dismantling of systems of oppression and mechanisms of domination?

According to Meyerhoff is it important to distinguish education from study.

> "Education has been presented as if it is the best and only option for studying. Against the grain, my book takes aim at the romance of education. I contend that education is one possible mode of study among many alternatives"

## Sociological Definition of Education

According to Emile Durkheim, “Education is, then, only the means by which society prepares within the children, the essential conditions of its very existence" from _Education and Sociology._

## Education and crisis

* Education is perceived as the institution that will solve all social problems.
* Education reforms are at the center of attention, shifting the focus away from political choices that actually maintain inequalities.

## Education and Inequalities

* Education does not reduce inequalities
* Education does not increase the minimum wage
* Education does not make healthcare free and universal
* Education does not create jobs

According to Roth (2015),
* Incapacity of the system to integrate on the job market.
* 40% of 18-24 years old are students according to the U.S. Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, National Center for Education Statistics.
