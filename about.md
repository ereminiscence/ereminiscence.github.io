## Information about EDUC 547 Anthropoly and Education

Anthropology and Education is a graduate seminar course taught at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education by Dr. Kathleen Hall.

Description from the syllabus:
"This graduate seminar considers how sociocultural anthropology has approached the study of education and of children and youth more broadly. A central aim of anthropological studies of education is to examine the relationships between education, culture, and society. Anthropologists have conceived of “education” in broad terms, not simply as formal schooling, but also as forms of learning and processes of cultural production that happen outside of school. Educational anthropologists have sought to understand how social persons are produced across “educational” contexts, such as schools, the family, peer and other communal groups as well as through the consumption of media and commodities. Education is a key site in which societies define and debate their core values and imagine their ideal futures and future citizens. Hence, educational processes are also highly contentious and contested. Struggles to control educational policy and practice within a nation, then, involve politics that are deeply cultural and value-laden, and these debates, moreover, provide a window to core dilemmas at the heart of a society’s efforts to define itself at any particular historical moment."

I created this website as final project for this course and as a tool to share my understanding of education.
